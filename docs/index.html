  <H2>Academic Career (1998-2021)</H2>
    <P>
      For this period of 24 years I was at the
      Logic and Computation Group in the 
      <a href= http://rsise.anu.edu.au/ >
      Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering</a>
      at the <A href="http://www.anu.edu.au/textonly/external.html" >
      Australian National University</A>,
      subsequently in the <a href= http://cs.anu.edu.au/ >
      Research School of Computer Science</a>,
      part of the <a href= http://cecs.anu.edu.au/ >
      College of Engineering and Computer Science</a>,
      see further details <a href = anu.html >here</a>.
      
  <H2>Retirement</H2>
  In retirement I've been doing more of a variety of things, including
  <ul>
  <li> some category theory proofs in Coq
  <li> reverting to my earlier interest in the law, 
    including being rather outspoken
  about legal issues and cases that attract my interest, see further 
  <a href = legal/ >here</a>
  <li> I'm also starting a set of pages called the
  <a href = ./streisand-effect/index.html >Streisand Effect</a>,
  designed to try to give maximum publicity to writings with others have tried
  to punish or suppress.
  <li> I'm also an active bridge player, at
      <a href= https://www.capital.bridge-club.org/ >
      Capital Bridge Club</a>.
      Our club (together with Jamison) is supporting
      a new weekly social bridge activity, at 
      <a href = https://www.thehenry.com.au >The Henry, Higgins</a>
      and <a href = ./bridge-henry/ >here</a> (initially, at least) is 
      its website.

  </ul>
