  <H1>Palestine Congress in Berlin</H1>
In April 2024 German police shut down the 
<a href = https://palaestinakongress.de/en >Palestine Congress in Berlin</a>,
<p>
described by 
<a href = 
https://consortiumnews.com/2024/04/15/german-police-shut-down-palestine-conference/
>Consortium News</a>
<a href =
https://mondoweiss.net/2024/04/police-raid-berlin-conference-as-repression-of-palestine-activism-escalates-in-germany/ 
>Mondoweiss</a>, and
<a href =
https://www.newarab.com/news/inside-germanys-orwellian-crackdown-palestine-congress
>the New Arab</a>.
Incidentally, another <a href =
https://www.newarab.com/features/legal-battle-protect-germanys-pro-palestine-movement
>article in the New Arab</a> seems to indicate how horribly authoritarian
Germany has become recently.
</p><p>
Indeed, the Consortium News article says
<blockquote>
<p>
Among those arrested by police at the Congress were Jewish activists.
</p><p>
Anti-Zionist Jewish activists are heavily targeted in Germany, despite
Germany’s attempt to justify its support to Israel as “collective
guilt” over the holocaust and repenting for its infamous antisemitism.
</p><p>
Yet, according to researcher Emily Dische-Becker, almost a third of those
deplatformed, arrested, or otherwise sanctioned for alleged antisemitism
are themselves Jewish. Videos from the repression show a Jewish activist
being arrested outside of the conference, with police seizing a banner
that read “Jew Against Genocide.”
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>
<h2>Ghassan Abu Sitta</h2>
<p>
One of the intended speakers at the Congress was Ghassan Abu Sitta,
Palestinian-British surgeon and the rector of Glasgow University,
who was denied entry into Germany.
The German authorities also threatened him with legal action
if he dared send his intended speech by video.
See <a href = 
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/ghassan-abu-sittah-accuses-germany-complicity-genocide-refused-entry
>this article</a>, which says he was 
"to give my evidence of the 43 days that I had seen in the hospitals in Gaza,
working in both al-Shifa and al-Ahli hospitals".
He says
"This is exactly what accomplices to a crime do.
They bury the evidence and they silence or harass or intimidate the witnesses"

As a consequence (so it is said) of this ban, he was also prevented from
entering France and the Netherlands.
(I find it difficult to believe that Germany can ban someone from entering 
other countries - I would think that these other countries have made their
own decision to ban him, but if I'm wrong on this, please let me know.)
However a court in Germany has overturned this ban - see <a href =

Dr Abu Sittah was the subject of a complaint by a pro-Israel pressure group,
UK Lawyers for Israel, which the General Medical Council referred to a
Tribunal, which dismissed the complaint.

<h2>Yanis Varoufakis</h2>
<p>
He was also <a href = https://diem25.org/diem25-and-mera25-engage-in-palestine-congress-for-solidarity-justice-and-peace/
>prevented from speaking at the Palestine Congress</a>,
and, apparently, <a href =
https://diem25.org/chronicle-of-the-betatigungsverbot-against-yanis-varoufakis/
>informed that he was banned from making speeches</a>,
though apparently the authorities later denied this.
</p> <p>
Anyway, <a href = https://diem25.org/yanis-varoufakis-palestine-congress-speech-that-was-banned-by-german-police/
>here is the speech</a> he had intended to give at the Congress.
</p>

<h2><a href = https://palaestinakongress.de/kongress-im-exil-speaker >
Palestine Conference in Exile</a></h2>
<p>
Apparently this event was held online on 25-26 July.
One guesses that it was organised from within Germany.
Ali Abunimah (co-founder of The Electronic Intifada, and
mentioned elsewhere in these pages) says
<a href =
https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/germany-threatening-me-prison-talk-palestine
>in this EI article</a>
<blockquote> <p>
Authorities in Berlin are threatening me with prison for giving a speech
via Zoom to an audience in Germany on that country’s role in Israel’s
ongoing holocaust against the Palestinian people in Gaza.
</p> <p>
I gave the talk anyway to thousands of people viewing it online, and you
can watch it in the video above. It was part of the Palestine Conference
in Exile held online on 25-26 July.
</p> <p>
About two hours before my scheduled talk on 26 July, I received via a
lawyer in Germany a 15-page notice from government authorities in Berlin
informing me that I am prohibited from participating in the conference
by any means, including online. The penalties include fines and up to
one year in prison.
</p> </blockquote>
As he indicates his video talk is available in the article linked above.
It is also available among the
<a href = https://palaestinakongress.de/recordings >
full proceedings of the Congress</a>.
</p> <p>
As an aside, it occurs to me that the German authorities are either
not too bright, or really desperate, or both. 
Firstly, when one gives a speech via Zoom, it is not to any particular
audience, but to anyone whom the host of the meeting allows in.  
Secondly, if he were bothered about the prohibition, he could give a 
speech on his own Youtube channel (or similar) 
(or the EI's Youtube channel, or the EI's own website), 
which anyone, including those attending the conference, could watch.
Thirdly, [the page shown on Twitter of] the notice sent to him is 
written in German - not much use in connection with a congress which
was conducted in English.
And fourthly, hopefully, this would attract more attention to his talk
(which is my purpose in producing these webpages).
