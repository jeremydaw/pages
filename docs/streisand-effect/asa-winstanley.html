  <H1>Asa Winstanley</H1>
<p>
What happened is best described in his own 
<a href = https://asawinstanley.substack.com/p/they-wont-stop-us-that-easily >
words</a>.
</p><p>
The events were also described
<a href = https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/uk-police-raid-home-seize-devices-eis-asa-winstanley >here</a>.
</p><p>
Asa was awakened at 5:40 am by a police raid, said to be "on account of [his]
social media posts", in connection with possible offences under
sections 1 and 2 of the Terrorism Act (2006).
</p><p>
Asa has just published another article about it, 
<a href =
https://asawinstanley.substack.com/p/did-british-police-raid-me-for-this
>here</a>
</p><p>
Why the raid was scheduled for 5:40am was not apparent. Nor was why, to find
material he has posted on the internet, looking on the internet isn't the 
way to go.
</p><p>
In any event, I encourage you to look at his writings that are so disliked
by the authorities:
his substack,
<a href = https://asawinstanley.substack.com/ >Palestine is Still the
Issue</a>,
and the
<a href = https://electronicintifada.net/people/asa-winstanley 
>Electronic Intifada</a> give you plenty.
</p><p>
According to the 
<a href = https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/10/18/vmbx-o18.html >
World Socialist Web Site</a>
<blockquote>
Winstanley is associate editor at 
<a href = https://electronicintifada.net >The Electronic Intifada</a>,
and has also written for

</blockquote>
</p><p>
One must of course ask: does any of his writing amount to
"encouragement of terrorism"?  
Probably. 
Does that bother me? 
Not a bit.
Why?
Because of the ludicrously broad definition of terrorism
under the Terrorism Acts -  
under which I myself am a "terrorist" (on account of my service with the
school cadets at my secondary school nearly 60 years ago).
A <a href = ./terrorism.html >future article</a> will elaborate on this.
</p><p>
Of course, if anyone comes across anything he has written which offends
against the Terrorism Acts <i>and</i> is actually objectionable, do let me
know.
For example, had he supported cutting off water and power from Gaza.
(For this example of conduct offending against the Terrorism Acts
I am indebted to 
<a href = https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/sir-keir-starmer-hamas-terrorism-israel-defend-itself/ 
>Sir Keir Starmer</a>.)

</p><p>
An internet search reveals that this event was
hardly covered by the mainstream media, the one exception I found being
<a href =
https://www.thenational.scot/news/24663361.counterterrorism-police-raid-home-pro-palestine-journalist-londo/
>the National (Scotland)</a>.
So here are my reading recommendations from among sources that did cover it.

by subscribing I got them sent by email).

So please don't make the mistake of thinking your attempts to disrupt
their narrative control aren't working. Don't let anyone tell you
your protests don't make a difference or your dissident speech poses
no threat to the powerful. If what we're doing wasn't working,
empire managers wouldn't be going nuts trying to stop us.

Panicked Zionist "elites" who run western states are lashing out in

<blockquote> <p>
British counter-terrorism police visited the home of a man under suspicion
of practising journalism. Disgustingly, the man had been raising awareness
of Israel's genocide, and therefore had to be dealt with.
</p><p>
... Asa Winstanley. He is one of the most prominent figures in the worrying
wave of radicals who believe genocide is wrong, even when Israel does it

<p>
Did I mention her work is described as "parody/satire"? Which is why
I always enjoy reading her articles.  Though last time I
looked up to see what was the truth underlying 
<a href = https://www.normalisland.co.uk/p/the-real-victim-of-genocide-is-the
>one of her articles</a>,
I found the facts were just as extraordinary as the "parody/satire".

>Ricky / Council Estate Media</a>, <!-- https://archive.vn/dnimt --> who says
<blockquote> <p>
Personally, I don’t think any of the recent arrests/visits by
counter-terrorism police are going to result in convictions. I hope I’m
not tempting fate, but I think this is primarily about intimidation,
and that is despicable in itself.
</p><p>
The mistake Asa made is the same mistake I made: he built up a platform
and challenged powerful people. If you do that, those powerful people
will come for you. All of us with a sizable platform are waiting to be
next. It’s genuinely nuts.
</p> </blockquote>
</li><li>
Finally,
<a href = 
https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-coconut-trial-the-insane-suppression
>Aya / Challenge the Narrative</a>,
a recommendation not because of writing about Asa Winstanley:
but because she discussed the Terrorism Acts,
which was helpful for my <a href = ./terrorism.html >own article</a>.
She writes very powerfully and passionately, eg, 
<a href = https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-final-solution-in-gaza-is-happening 
>here</a>, leaving me wondering if there is something wrong with me, 
that I don't feel it nearly so intensely.
