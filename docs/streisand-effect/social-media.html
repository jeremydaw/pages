  <H1>Social media censorship</H1>
Here we list cases where social media platforms
"de-platform" particular contributors on
account of the political views expressed, and delete their articles,
or restrict visibility of some articles/videos.
Also where payment processors refuse to process payments for particular content
creators, for similar reasons.

<h2>Scott Ritter</h2>
In <a href = https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-trump-litmus-test
>this article</a> referring to his two-part documentary, "Agent Zelensky"
he says
<blockquote>
YouTube deplatformed the documentary, demonetized my account, and
eventually banned me from the platform altogether.
</blockquote>
This documentary is described

<a href =

and <a href =

and is available on Rumble

<h2>Chris Hedges</h2>
<a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/on-being-disappeared >
He writes</a>
<blockquote> <p>
The entire archive of On Contact, the Emmy-nominated show I hosted for six
years for RT America and RT International, has been disappeared from YouTube...
</p> <p>
I was on RT because, as a critic of US imperialism, militarism, the
corporate control of the two ruling parties, and especially because I
support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel,
I was blacklisted.  I was on RT for the same reason the dissident Vaclav
Havel, who I knew, was on Voice of America during the communist regime
in Czechoslovakia. It was that or not be heard. Havel had no more love
for the policies of Washington than I have for those of Moscow.
</p> <p>
What were my sins? I did not, like my former employer, The New York
Times, sell you the lie of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, peddle
conspiracy theories about Donald Trump being a Russian asset, put out a
ten-part podcast called the Caliphate that was a hoax, or tell you that
the contents on Hunter Biden’s laptop was “disinformation.”
</p> </blockquote>
<p>
In fact an <a href = https://www.rt.com/shows/on-contact/ >
archive of the On Contact shows</a> seems to be available on rt.com,
but only up to February 2022 (shortly before the article linked above
appeared). Then there is also a <a href =
https://www.youtube.com/@chrishedges7414/videos >Youtube channel</a>
currently available which apparently contains episodes from 7 and 8 years ago.
</p> <p>
Meanwhile, he has lots of up-to-date videos and articles on his
<a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com >substack</a>
