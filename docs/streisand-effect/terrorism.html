  <H2>Introduction</H2>
Before going into detail about the legislation, let me refer you to 
Craig Murray's article
<a href = https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2024/10/who-are-the-terrorists/ 
>Who Are the Terrorists?</a>
pointing out that the UK government regarded Nelson Mandela as a terrorist,
and the African National Congress as a terrorist organisation,
but, nonetheless, thousands of people wrote in support of them.
He goes on to say
<blockquote>
Under today’s legislation, every single one of those people writing
in support of the African National Congress or out campaigning for the
release of Nelson Mandela would have been liable for arrest under Section
12(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act.
</blockquote>
In the same vein, Jonathan Cook has written, in
<a href = https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2024-08-30/starmer-jailing-palestine-supporters/
>Starmer's purges of Labour have mutated into the arrest of Palestine supporters
</a>
<blockquote> <p>
The need for careful distinctions should be obvious. Would praising
Hamas leaders, even its military leaders, for agreeing to sit down in
peace talks amount to “support” for a terror organisation? Should
it lead to arrest and jail time?
</p><p>
It was never a crime to “support” Sinn Fein – the political wing
of the IRA – in the sense of having complimentary things to say about
its long-time leader, Gerry Adams, or backing its political positions.
</p><p>
It wasn’t even illegal to “support” actual IRA
“terrorists”. Back in the early 1980s, many people criticised the
Ulster authorities and the British government of Margaret Thatcher for
their barbaric treatment of IRA prisoners.
</p></blockquote>
UPDATE (Jan 2025): In another more recent article Craig discusses
<a href =
https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2025/01/will-section-12-die-of-shame/
>the hypocrisy of the UK government</a> in relation to its support of HTS
(the new Syrian government):
<blockquote> <p>
Until the government, through an Order in Council, actually removes the
proscription of HTS as a terrorist organisation, it is still illegal
to support it in the UK – and it is illegal for government ministers
to support it, let alone ex-functionaries like John Sawers, Alastair
Campbell and Rory Stewart.
</p> <p>
Now in practice, there is nothing to prevent the massive hypocrisy of
the Terrorism Police harassing, and the CPS prosecuting, people for very
tangential “support” of Hamas and Hezbollah, while much more blatant
and open support of HTS goes unpunished.
</p> </blockquote>
<p>
UPDATE (Feb 2025): In another more recent article Craig tells us
<a href = https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2025/02/united-nations-censures-uk-over-abuse-of-terrorism-act-against-journalists-and-activists/
>United Nations Censures UK Over Abuse of Terrorism Act Against Journalists and
Activists</a>:
as he says, "the second part [of the
<a href = https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL-GBR-15-2024-Craig-Murray-et-al-UN-comm-to-UK-with-cover.pdf
>letter from the UN</a>] 
is a devastating critique of the UK’s terrorism laws".
</p><p>
There is also an <a href =
https://skwawkbox.org/2025/02/06/un-slams-uk-for-starmers-war-on-pro-gaza-journalism-and-activism/
>article on Skwawkbox</a> about this which concludes
<blockquote>
The letter – unsurprisingly, as a formal and legally-constructed
United Nations communication – accuse the Starmer regime of the
deliberate abuse of shoddy legislation to harass, intimidate, threaten
and criminalise free speech on Palestine to protect Israel, because of
Starmer’s absolute commitment to Zionism and the ‘right’ of Israel
to slaughter and act as it wishes.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Now let me bore you with the detail.
</p>

  <H2>The UK Terrorism Acts</H2>
<p>
Firstly, note that there are two of them,
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/contents >2000</a>
and 
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/contents >2006</a>.

<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/1 
>Section 1 of the 2000 Act</a> gives the definition of terrorism which
is used in both Acts (see
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/20
>s20(1) of the 2006 Act)</a>
</p><p>
<b>Terrorism: interpretation.</b>
<blockquote> <p>
(1) In this Act, "terrorism" means the use or threat of action where:
<blockquote> <p>
    (a) the action falls within subsection (2);
</p><p>
    (b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government or an
    international governmental organisation or to intimidate the public
    or a section of the public; and
</p><p>
    (c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a
    political, religious, racial or ideological cause.
</p> </blockquote>
(2)    Action falls within this subsection if it:
<blockquote> <p>
    (a) involves serious violence against a person;
</p><p>
    (b) involves serious damage to property;
</p><p>
    (c) endangers a person's life, other than that of the person
    committing the action;
</p><p>
    (d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or
    a section of the public; or
</p><p>
    (e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt
    an electronic system.
</p> </blockquote>
(3)   The use or threat of action falling within subsection (2) which
involves the use of firearms or explosives is terrorism whether or not
subsection (1)(b) is satisfied.
<p></p>
(4)   In this section:
<blockquote> <p>
(a) "action" includes action outside the United Kingdom; and
</p><p>
(b) a reference to any person or to property is a reference to any person,
or to property, wherever situated,
</p><p>
(c) a reference to the public includes a reference to the public of a
country other than the United Kingdom, and
</p><p>
(d) "the government" means the government of the United Kingdom, of a
Part of the United Kingdom or of a country other than the United Kingdom.
</p> </blockquote>
(5) In this Act a reference to action taken for the purposes of terrorism
includes a reference to action taken for the benefit of a proscribed
organisation.
</p> </blockquote>
<p>
And that's it.
Nothing about who is doing it, whether the military of the UK or another
country or the military forces of a de-facto government or anyone else.
Nothing about whether things are being done in a "just cause",
however you might assess that.
</p> <p>
In short, it covers equally what might be more usually described
as "war-fighting" than as "terrorism", and whether or not the war-fighting
is legal or "just" or involves war crimes or not.
</p> <p>
Less surprisingly, nothing about whether the activities in question
are or were commanded by God (as, eg, in
<a href = https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7.htm
>Deuteronomy 7:1-6</a> or
<a href = https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13.htm#6 >
Deuteronomy 13:6-15</a>).
</p>
<h2>Offences</h2>
<p>
So what are the offences related to terrorism?
</p> <p>
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/1 
>Section 1 of the 2006 Act</a>: <b>Encouragement of terrorism</b>
</p>
<blockquote> <p>
(1) This section applies to a statement that is likely to be understood by
a reasonable person as a direct or indirect encouragement or other
inducement to some or all of the members of the public to whom it
is published, to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of
terrorism or Convention offences.
</p> <p>
(2) A person commits an offence if-
<blockquote> <p>
(a) he publishes a statement to which this section applies or causes
another to publish such a statement; and
</p><p>
(b) at the time he publishes it or causes it to be published, he-
<blockquote> <p>
(i) intends members of the public to be directly or indirectly encouraged
or otherwise induced by the statement to commit, prepare or instigate
acts of terrorism or Convention offences; or
</p><p>
(ii) is reckless as to whether members of the public will be directly or
indirectly encouraged or otherwise induced by the statement to commit,
prepare or instigate such acts or offences.
</p> </blockquote>
</p> </blockquote>
(3) For the purposes of this section, the statements that are likely to
be understood by a reasonable person as indirectly encouraging the
commission or preparation of acts of terrorism or Convention offences
include every statement which-
<blockquote> <p>
(a) glorifies the commission or preparation (whether in the past, in
the future or generally) of such acts or offences; and
</p><p>
(b) is a statement from which members of the public could reasonably
be expected to infer that what is being glorified is being glorified as
conduct that should be emulated by them in existing circumstances.
</p> </blockquote>
(4) For the purposes of this section the questions how a statement is
likely to be understood and what members of the public could reasonably
be expected to infer from it must be determined having regard both-
<blockquote> <p>
(a) to the contents of the statement as a whole; and
</p><p>
(b) to the circumstances and manner of its publication.
</p> </blockquote>
(5) It is irrelevant for the purposes of subsections (1) to (3)-
<blockquote> <p>
(a) whether anything mentioned in those subsections relates to the
commission, preparation or instigation of one or more particular acts
of terrorism or Convention offences, of acts of terrorism or Convention
offences of a particular description or of acts of terrorism or Convention
offences generally; and,
</p><p>
(b) whether any person is in fact encouraged or induced by the statement
to commit, prepare or instigate any such act or offence.
</p> </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
So these provisions apparently apply, for example, to the following examples:
<ul> <li>
Arguing that particular violent action (meeting the defintion of "terrorism")
is justified
</li> <li>
Arguing that it is not justified, and accordingly violent resistance to it
is justified
</li> </ul>
</p>
<h2>Proscribed organisations</h2>
<p>
Per <a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/3 >
Section 3</a> and following, 
the Secretary of State may proscribe an organisation
if he believes that it is concerned in terrorism, 
which, as described above, is a very low bar.
There is apparently no obligation upon him to proscribe such an organisation,
so he can limit proscribed organisations to ones he doesn't like.
</p><p>
But once an organisation is proscribed, then it is an offence to "support" it.
</p><p>
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/12 
>Section 12 of the 2000 Act</a>: <b>Support</b>
</p>
<blockquote> <p>
(1) A person commits an offence if-
<blockquote> <p>
(a) he invites support for a proscribed organisation, and
</p><p>
(b) the support is not, or is not restricted to, the provision of money or other property (within the meaning of section 15).
</p> </blockquote>
(1A) A person commits an offence if the person-
<blockquote> <p>
(a) expresses an opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed
organisation, and
</p><p>
(b) in doing so is reckless as to whether a person to whom the expression
is directed will be encouraged to support a proscribed organisation.
</p> </blockquote>
(2) A person commits an offence if he arranges, manages or assists in
arranging or managing a meeting which he knows is-
<blockquote> <p>
(a) to support a proscribed organisation,
</p><p>
(b) to further the activities of a proscribed organisation, or
</p><p>
(c) to be addressed by a person who belongs or professes to belong to a
proscribed organisation.
</p> </blockquote>
(3) A person commits an offence if he addresses a meeting and the purpose
of his address is to encourage support for a proscribed organisation or
to further its activities.
</p> </blockquote>
<p>
The word "support" is, conveniently, not defined.
Does it mean something like "assist in the affairs of",
or merely something like "express approval of", or even just "approve of"? 
</p><p>
In the case
<a href = https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2016/61.html >
Choudary & Anor v R. [2016] EWCA Crim 61</a> the Court said
at para 35 <!-- see also paras 5,6,51,70 -->
<blockquote>
[the section] does not prohibit the holding of opinions or beliefs
supportive of a proscribed organisation; or the expression of those
opinions or beliefs
</blockquote>
<!-- see para 25 of 
  https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/notes/division/6/index.htm -->
But that was before s12(1A) was inserted (apparently as a result of this case).
And "support", as in s12(1A)(b) now, is still not clearly defined.

</p><p>
So, where a proscribed organisation is a government (or some sort of 
pseudo-government), is it an offence to
<ul><li>
express approval of any government (or the like) operating
schools, hospitals and so forth?
</li><li>
express approval of a particular government (or the like) operating
schools, hospitals and so forth?
</li><li>
express an opinion as to the legality (or otherwise) of any action it
undertakes, or its adversaries undertake?
</li><li>
express an opinion as to whether in fact it meets the requirements
to be proscribed?
</li></ul>
Who knows?
Which I guess is exactly the point.  
The authorities can justify prosecuting anyone whose views they don't like.
And of course, even in the event of acquittal, 
for a defendant, undergoing the process itself is substantial punishment.
</p>
<h2>Schedule 7</h2>
<p>
By <a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/schedule/7 >
Schedule 7 of the 2000 Act</a>, sub-paragraph 2(1), 
a person arriving in the UK may be questioned 
<blockquote>
... for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be a person
falling within section 
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/40 >
40(1)(b)</a>
</blockquote>
that is, a person who 
<blockquote>
is or has been concerned in the commission,
preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism
</blockquote>
(as defined in Section 1).
</p><p>
Since it says
"<i>being concerned in</i> the commission [etc] of acts of terrorism"
rather than, for example, <i>encouraging</i> or <i>inducing</i>
the commission [etc] of such acts (as in Section 1 of the 2006 Act),
one might think it means some actual involvement.
If so it is hard to imagine what grounds the authorities might have had for
applying Schedule 7 to 
<a href = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/20/chilling-arrest-of-french-publisher-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police-condemned-ernest-moret
>Ernest Moret</a> or
<a href = https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2023/10/incredibly-i-face-investigation-for-terrorism-defence-funds-appeal/
> Craig Murray</a>.
<!-- "concerned in terrorism" is partly defined, for the purposes of
  s3(4) (2000 Act) in s3(5) -->
But then, it is stated specifically, in sub-paragraph 2(4), that
<blockquote>
An examining officer may exercise his powers under this paragraph whether
or not he has grounds for suspecting that a person falls within section
40(1)(b)
</blockquote>
So there it is, this encourages them to do this to anyone they choose.
In fact, according to David Miller, 
<a href = https://trackingpower.substack.com/p/what-is-islamophobia >
people of Pakistani ethnicity are over 150 times more likely
to be detained under Schedule 7 than white people</a>. 
</p><p>
On the other hand the questioning must be 
<i>
for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be a person who ...
</i>
I'd certainly like to see the results of a case where the police were required
to show that that was in fact their purpose.
</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>
Then of course there is training. 
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/6 >
Section 6 of the 2006 Act</a> covers training
"in connection with ... acts of terrorism" (though there need not be 
<i>specific</i> acts in view),
and we have discussed how broadly "terrorism" is defined.

</p><p>
Somewhat overlapping this is 
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/54 >
Section 54 of the 2000 Act</a> 
</p><p>
<b>54 Weapons training.</b>
<blockquote>
(1) A person commits an offence if he provides instruction or training
in the making or use of-
<blockquote>
(a) firearms
</blockquote>
(2) A person commits an offence if he receives instruction or training
in the making or use of-
<blockquote>
(a) firearms
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
This seems to cover, fair and square, my own involvement in the school cadets
at my secondary school.
In my defence, I was never a particularly enthusiastic cadet - most of the kids
in my class were promoted to corporal for our second year, but not I.
Though admittedly, this was more because of my lack of interest in polishing
boots and belt buckles, rather than because of a distaste for racing around the
bush firing rifles (loaded with blanks) at pretend Vietnamese peasants.
</p><p>
There is a defence - if the person charged can prove that his involvement
was nothing to do with terrorism (as defined, broadly, discussed above
- difficult to prove, I imagine, when the training is intended to introduce one
to the possibility of a career which would include firing rifles at 
Vietnamese peasants).
</p><p>
And both these sections about training offences apply to training outside the
UK
(<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/17 
>Section 17 of the 2006 Act</a>)
and the terrorism envisaged in the training may also be outside the UK
(s1(4) of the 2000 Act, quoted above).
Thus the fact that my own "terrorist training" took place in Australia
is beside the point.
This, then, makes me a "terrorist" 
(<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/40 
>Section 40 of the 2000 Act</a>)
and so subject to arrest without a warrant
(<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/41 
>Section 41(1) of the 2000 Act</a>).  </p>

<h2> Further lunatic provisions</h2>
<p>
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/58 >
Section 58 of the 2000 Act</a>
makes it an offence to record, possess or view over the internet
"information of a kind likely to be useful to [a terrorist]" (s58(1)).
Which obviously includes road maps, train or bus timetables, and so forth.
</p><p>
In the case of this provision the House of Lords has said, in
<a href = https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/13.html >
R v G, R v J [2009] UKHL 13</a>
<blockquote>
42. Parliament cannot have intended to criminalise the possession of
information of a kind which is useful to people for all sorts of everyday
purposes and which many members of the public regularly obtain or use,
simply because that information could also be useful to someone who was
preparing an act of terrorism.
</blockquote>
It's nice that in this case the court has decided that what the Act says
is too stupid to be taken seriously. But one can never rely on the courts
taking this approach.
</p><p>
There is a defence of "reasonable excuse" (s58(3)),
of which examples are given (s58(3A)). 
Bizarrely, one of the examples of reasonable excuse is one of the possible
scenarios where there is an absence of <i>mens rea</i>,
see paras 47, 50 and 60 of R v G, R v J.
But a notable omission from the examples of reasonable excuse is the very
likely candidate, having a reason for the possession (etc)
that is nothing to do with terrorism.
In fact the House of Lords, in R v G, R v J, overruling an earlier case,
decided that this would not necessarily be a reasonable excuse
(paras 71 to 73 and following).
</p>

<h2>The Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act </h2>
<p>
There seems to be quite a smorgasbord of legislation which
the authorities can use against people they don't like.
In the case of 
<a href = https://thegrayzone.com/2023/05/30/journalist-kit-klarenberg-british-police-interrogated-grayzone/
>Kit Klarenberg</a> it was the
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/contents >
Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019</a>
Mostly, it seems, this Act amends the Terrorism Acts 2000 and 2006,
but its 
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/schedule/3 
>Schedule 3</a> seems to provide new powers.
Schedule 3 seems to be mostly very similar to Schedule 7 of the 
Terrorism Act 2000 but for a different purpose.
</p><p>
By <a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/schedule/3 >
Schedule 3</a>, sub-paragraph 1(1), 
a person arriving in the UK may be questioned 
<blockquote>
... for the purpose of determining whether the person appears to be a person
who is, or has been, engaged in hostile activity ...
</blockquote>
The definition of "hostile activity" seems arguably sensible, 
but as with Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, we have in,
sub-paragraph 1(4)
<blockquote>
An examining officer may exercise his powers under this paragraph whether
or not he has grounds for suspecting that a person is or has been engaged 
in hostile activity.
</blockquote>
<!-- see 
  https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/notes/division/6/index.htm -->
But, again, the questioning must be for this purpose.
</p>
<h2>R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64</h2>
<p>
Thanks to 
<a href =
https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-coconut-trial-the-insane-suppression
>Aya / Challenge the Narrative</a> for mentioning this case.
<!--

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62rgvyr19no
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5113ey9gw2o
-->
The case 
<a href = https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/64.html >
R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64</a>, in the Supreme Court,
<!-- on appeal from 
<a href = https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2012/280.html >
R v Gul [2012] EWCA Crim 280</a> -->
was primarily about the meaning of "terrorism" in section 1
of the Terrorism Act 2000.
</p><p>
It says a lot about the breadth of the definition of terrorism, 
notably in paragraphs 28,29,33,34,61.
In particular:
(the following expressed rather tentatively in para 28)
<blockquote>
... the definition of terrorism in section 1 in the 2000 Act is, at
least if read in its natural sense, very far reaching indeed. Thus,
on occasions, activities which might command a measure of public
understanding, if not support, may fall within it: for example, activities
by the victims of oppression abroad, which might command a measure of
public understanding, and even support in this country, may well fall
within it. 
</blockquote>
The following are about or quoted from an Independent Reviewer 
of the legislation.
<blockquote>
actions may amount to terrorism within the definition "even when they might
otherwise constitute lawful hostilities under international humanitarian law
(e.g. acts of violent rebellion against oppressive governments)" (para 33)
<!-- this paraphrases par 3.9 of THE TERRORISM ACTS IN 2011, JUNE 2012 -->
</blockquote>
and the definition was referred to as
<blockquote>
"remarkably broad – absurdly so in some cases" (para 34)
<!-- this comes from par 4.3(b) of THE TERRORISM ACTS IN 2012, JULY 2013 -->
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"the current law allows members of any nationalist or separatist group to be
turned into terrorists by virtue of their participation in a lawful armed
conflict, however great the provocation and however odious the regime which
they have attacked" (para 61)
<!-- this comes from par 3.11 of THE TERRORISM ACTS IN 2011, JUNE 2012 -->
</blockquote>
The judgment makes the point that the consent of the DPP is required for
a prosecution, this being seen as "ensuring that a prosecution should not be
instigated nor proceed if this would not be in the public interest" (para 36). 
However, importantly, the Court pointed out
<blockquote>
The Crown's reliance on prosecutorial discretion is intrinsically
unattractive, as it amounts to saying that the legislature, whose primary
duty is to make the law, and to do so in public, has in effect delegated
to an appointee of the executive, albeit a respected and independent
lawyer, the decision whether an activity should be treated as criminal
for the purposes of prosecution.

... [This] risks undermining the rule of law. It involves Parliament
abdicating a significant part of its legislative function to an unelected DPP,
or to the Attorney General, who, though he is accountable to Parliament,
does not make open, democratically accountable decisions in the same
way as Parliament.  Further, such a device leaves citizens unclear as to
whether or not their actions or projected actions are liable to be treated
by the prosecution authorities as effectively innocent or criminal ...
</blockquote>
Furthermore the protection afforded by the DPP's "prosecutorial discretion"
applies only to the bringing of charges to court.

Regarding "police officers deciding whom to arrest or to stop at a port" (para
34), or the Home Secretary deciding which organisations to proscribe, it
provides no such protection.
The judgment discusses this in paras 33,34,37,63,64.
Thus the Independent Reviewer referred to 
<blockquote>
the risk that "strong powers could be used for purposes other than the
suppression of terrorism as it is generally understood" (para 33) 
<!-- this comes from par 3.7(d) of THE TERRORISM ACTS IN 2011, JUNE 2012 -->
</blockquote>
and that even where the activity does not warrant prosecution
<blockquote>
First, the lawfulness of executive acts such as detention, search,
interrogation and arrest could be questioned only very rarely indeed in
relation to any actual or suspected involvement in actual or projected
acts involving "terrorism", in circumstances where there would be no
conceivable prospect of such involvement being prosecuted. Secondly, the
fact that an actual or projected activity technically involves "terrorism"
means that, as a matter of law, that activity will be criminal under
the provisions of the 2000 and 2006 Acts, long before, and indeed quite
irrespective of whether, any question of prosecution arises. (para 37)
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The judgment in the appeal (para 5) recounts how, in the trial the jury asked
<blockquote>
"Re: definition of terrorism in [section 1 of the 2000 Act],
would the use of force by Coalition forces be classed as terrorism?"
</blockquote>
In relation to that question, the judge gave the following direction:
<blockquote>
"... the use of force by Coalition forces is not terrorism. They do enjoy
combat immunity, they are ordered there by our government and the American
government, unless they commit crimes such as torture or war crimes ...".
</blockquote>
I have to say that I am not at all surprised that there should be some such
legal principle giving such forces "combat immunity".
But I would be very surprised indeed if there were legislation somewhere
(of which I've not seen any hint) which amends the definition of 
"terrorism" in the 2000 Act to exclude action by "Coalition forces".

In fact, the Independent Reviewer mentioned the
"potential application of the Terrorism Acts even to UK forces
engaged in conflicts overseas" (para 61).

<h3>R v F [2007] EWCA Crim 243</h3>
<p>

The case 
<a href = https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2007/243.html >
R v F [2007] EWCA Crim 243</a>, in the Court of Appeal,
also primarily about the meaning of "terrorism" in section 1
of the Terrorism Act 2000, makes some similar points at paras 11,27,32.
<!--
-->
<blockquote>
11. ... "counter-terrorism measures were capable of application to speech
or actions concerning resistance to an oppressive regime overseas ..."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
27. ... Finally, the legislation does not ... exculpate
what some would describe as terrorism in a just cause.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
32. ... the terrorist legislation applies to countries which are governed
by tyrants and dictators. There is no exemption from criminal liability
for terrorist activities which are motivated or said to be morally
justified by the alleged nobility of the terrorist cause.

<h3>Another problem with prosecutorial discretion</h3>
<p>
As mentioned above, the consent of the DPP is required for a prosecution,
this being seen as "ensuring that a prosecution should not be instigated 
nor proceed if this would not be in the public interest",
and I've noted above what the Court said about that in R v Gul.
</p><p>
There is an additional problem with this line of thinking.
It accepts that there are some circumstances where there should not be
a prosecution, even when a literal application of the Acts 
to the facts of a case makes a defendant guilty.
But the jury, not the DPP, decides what facts have been proved 
against a defendant, and no one other than the jury will ever know what
facts have been proved.
So, if the surrounding circumstances, for example 
<ul><li> 
that the terrorism constitutes lawful hostilities under international
humanitarian law (e.g. acts of violent rebellion against oppressive
governments)
</li><li> 
that the terrorism is participation in a lawful armed conflict,
after great provocation and against an odious regime
</li></ul>
(these examples taken from R v Gul, see above)
justify saying the prosecution should not proceed, then
(unless all the facts are agreed) only the jury can decide this.
</p><p>
But there have been instances recently of judges refusing to allow defendants 
to give evidence or argue about aspects of a case which don't strictly affect 
guilt or not under the legislation as written - so then the jury wouldn't be
in a position to take these other aspects into account.
</p><p>
I will discuss this more in a page on Trudi Warner.

I think that Israel does have that right 
[ie cutting off water and electricity supplies to Gaza]

https://fullfact.org/live/2024/may/keir-starmer-gaza-poster/
Mr Ferrari then said: "A siege is appropriate? Cutting off power,
cutting off water?"

Mr Starmer responded: "I think that Israel does have that right. ..."

It does not matter to the police and the government that these cases,
at this stage, would not stand up in court. They have powers to detain,
seize and access devices, and impose stringent bail conditions well
before bringing the matter anywhere near a trial.
