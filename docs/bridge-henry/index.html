<font size=+2 face=arial>
The committee has decided to move our games at The Henry from Monday afternoons
to Thursday afternoons, at 1:00 - 4:00 PM<br><br>

This change will start soon: we will play on Monday 22 January 2024. <br>
The next game after that will be Thursday 1 February 2024. <br>
But note that the room will be unavailable on Thursdays 22 February and 7
March: arrangements for those weeks will be advised.

<font size=+2 face=arial color=red>IMPORTANT NEWS</font><br>
<font size=+2 face=arial>
We regret to announce the decision to dissolve the bridge group<br>
and cease our weekly games at the Henry, effective immediately.
</font>
</b>
<font size=+2 face=arial>
<br><br>
Despite everyone’s best efforts over a long period to grow the pool
of regular players to a sustainable 18–20 participants (enough for
3–4 tables of enjoyable competition), we’ve consistently faced the
challenge of low attendance. The reality of operating with just 2 to
2.5 tables for many months, coupled with little prospect of improvement,
has made it clear that continuing the competition is no longer viable.
<br><br>
We deeply appreciate the support and commitment from the Henry
since the beginning.
