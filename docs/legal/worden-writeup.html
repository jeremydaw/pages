<h3>Dr Robert Worden's evidence</h3>
In the Horizon Issues trial, statistical analyses were provided by 
the Post Office's expert witness, Dr Robert Worden.  
The judge, at para 805 of the judgment, quotes section 8.8.1 of
Dr Worden's report (paras 759 to 766), as follows:
</p><blockquote>
    760. Because Post Office has had an average of 13,560 branches over
    the lifetime of Horizon, the total number of monthly branch accounts
    has been about 3 million.
</p><p>
    761. Therefore, if a bug like the Suspense Account bug has occurred
    16 times in the lifetime of Horizon, the chance of it having occurred
    in any given branch in any given month is about 16 in 3 million. 
    [omitted text refines this calculation]
</p><p>
    762. I have considered a bug similar to the suspense account bug,
    which occurred about 10 times, and had a mean financial impact of
    about &pound;1000 per occurrence. How many similar bugs would be needed,
    to give a one in ten chance of one such bug occurring, with an impact
    of &pound;1000, on a particular Claimant's branch in a particular month?
</p><p>
    763. The answer, given by elementary arithmetic which I describe
    in section 8.5, is that there would need to be 50,000 of these
    distinct bugs.
</p><p>
    764. So the Claimants cannot credibly assert that their shortfalls
    were caused by bugs in Horizon, unless there were something of the
    order of 50,000 such bugs.
</blockquote><p>
This is complete nonsense.  It like arguing in a murder trial that
because the homicide rate in the UK is only 1 per 100,000 per year,
it is overwhelmingly unlikely that the defendant is guilty.
</p><p>
This is so obviously nonsense that it may be superfluous to ask what
is the flaw in the argument, but here it is.  
You can use his calcuation to get the probability that a
<em>randomly chosen</em> person committed the murder in question.
But the person on trial is <em>not</em> a person chosen <em>randomly</em>.
</p><p>
Likewise you could calculate the probability that a <em>randomly chosen</em>
subpostmaster has been affected by a Horizon bug, or at least make a 
conscientious attempt to do so, as Dr Worden has done.
But the subpostmasters who claim to have suffered unexplained shortfalls,
possibly Horizon related, are <em>not</em> a <em>randomly chosen</em> subset.
</p><p>
I'm told this statistical fallacy is surprisingly common.
I would hope it is not common among expert witnesses.
I'm sure it's not common among competent expert witnesses.
</p><p>
At this point there is not much more that needs to be said.  
But as I have spent so long reading the expert's report,
the transcripts and the judgment, I'm going to say some more anyway.
Skip it if you like, but do jump ahead to my heading "The Suspense Account" -
there are some different angles I discuss there.
</p><p>
Fortunately the judge gets this exactly right.
I suspect not all judges would.  At para 766 he says
</p><blockquote>
  I deal with that point in further detail below at [821] and [822]
  below, but this amounts to an assumption by Dr Worden that a group of
  SPMs who specifically allege they have experienced the effects of bugs
  are to be treated, in statistical terms, as though they are a random
  group of SPMs of the same sample size drawn from the wider population
  of all SPMs. They plainly are not a randomly drawn sample of nearly
  600 SPMs. They are a very specific group (or sample) of those who
  say their branch accounts have been impacted by, or have experienced,
  such incidents. In statistical terms, the correct term for the group
  is that they have a bias - they all allege that they have experienced
  the effects of bugs, errors and defects.
</blockquote><p>
After recounting Dr Worden's statistical evidence (para 805) he goes into
a long digression, and then (para 821) comes to the key issue:
</p><blockquote>
  However, the claimants are not a random sample of SPMs ...  As a sample,
  they have already been filtered or selected in that these particular
  SPMs already complain of bugs, defects and errors in Horizon having
  affected their branch accounts. This means that they are not a random
  sample. The way this would be expressed in statistical terms is that
  the claimant SPMs do not accurately represent the population of SPMs as
  a whole (...). The claimants are essentially self-selected, from those
  who believe they have experienced shortfalls and discrepancies in their
  accounts from the impact of bugs, errors and defects ...  The group
  has a bias, in statistical terms. They plainly cannot be treated,
  in statistical terms, as though they are a random group of 587 SPMs.
</blockquote><p>
Exactly. But I'd add that this is such an elementary blunder that this
guy should never be let near a witness-box again.
</p><p>
Dr Worden's report provides some other analyses, which essentially make
the same error in different ways.
Assuming that bugs in Horizon are equally spread across Post Office branches
and over time, and adjusted for how busy branches were, the effect of 
bugs on all branches would have been 160 times the effect of bugs on the
claimants.
</p><p>
In section 8.7.9 he analyses known problems with Horizon and produces an
estimate of the total effect of all bugs on Post Office branches.  
I assume for this discussion that it is possible to make a plausible
estimate and that he has done so.
Then his assumption that the effect is equally spread over branches
leads him to estimate the total effect of bugs on the claimants' branches.
This assumption is obviously unsound.  
Branches may well be equally likely to be affected,
based on their characteristics such as size, location, etc,
so if the claimants were a randomly chosen group of postmasters then
his analysis would be fine.
But the set of claimants consists of people who say they have
been affected - they are <em>not</em> a randomly chosen subset.
</p><p>
In section 8.8.2 he does essentially the same thing, here discussing
how if bugs affected all branches equally to the claimed effect on the
claimants' branches then the Call Centre (which took calls about problems
with Horizon) would have been inundated.  His reasoning here has the same  
flaw.
</p><p>
In cross-examination, this issue was discussed several times.

about 80% down, or search for "Penny Black".
They agreed to assume that one person in 500,000 in the UK is a lady called
Penny Black, and discussed the probability of finding one or more
such at a party of 50 people.
They then discussed the scenario of a party to which only people called
Penny Black had been invited.
Dr Worden said 
</p><blockquote>
  "I should say generally that probability theory is
  what one uses in the absence of specific knowledge like
  you have just put to me, and that specific knowledge
  changes the whole ball game."
</blockquote><p>
However Dr Worden did not accept that this is relevant to his analyses
about Horizon essentially because he should not assume that the claimants
are correct in their stated belief that they have been adversely affected
by bugs in Horizon. 
</p><p>
This doesn't change the fact that the claimants are not a random
set of postmasters, but a self-selected sample.
</p><p>
But here is an analogy: since I mention coin-tossing later, I'll do so here.
Imagine a number of coins have been tossed and lying on the ground.
Imagine then that someone, even somebody of doubtful honesty and worse eyesight
claims to have separated out those showing a "head" (leaving them
showing the same side as they fell).
</p><p>
So, for a coin among those which he has selected, what is the probability
that it shows a head?  You may not accept it as being 100% but you're
damn sure that you shouldn't treat it as 50%!
</p><p>
Unless Dr Worden is saying that his opinion is based on the assumption that
the claimants' evidence is so unreliable as to be quite worthless.
Now here is a legal, not a statistical, point, and one not noted in
the judgment, so I may be wrong: an expert opinion, when based on a
particular view of the primary facts, should say so, and if the court 
comes to a different view of those primary facts, then the expert opinion
becomes irrelevant.
[UPDATE: actually, pretty much this point is made in the judgment,
paras 831-2]
</p><p>
In any case, Dr Worden considers that he should disregard the claimants' 
evidence, and uses this assumption to construct a statistical argument
denying the validity of the claimants' evidence, so that is a circular 
argument.
[UPDATE: the judgment makes the same point about the circularity of
Dr Worden's argument that Horizon has had a
"good in-service record over 18 years", see para 819.9]

about 40% down, or search for "tweeting".
The barrister introduced a scenario similar to the Penny Black party,
and then said 
</p><blockquote>
  "I'm going to put a point to you that I'd be happy to put
  to my 13-year-old daughter, which is that when you look
  at a statistical sample the first thing you should do is
  look at the nature of the sample and how they were selected?"
</blockquote><p>
The ensuing discussion led to Dr Worden saying
</p><blockquote>
  "the claimants are a self-selected sample and they selected themselves long
  after they suffered their shortfalls.
  So the point you are putting to me effectively is
  these people selected themselves and that somehow caused
  Horizon several years previously to rain bugs on them.
  And so the causation is completely the wrong way round
  between Horizon affecting the claimants and the
  claimants self-selecting.  It doesn't make sense."
</blockquote><p>
and later 
</p><blockquote>
  "it [the fact that a postmaster believes that he/she has suffered in
  the way which is the subject of the proceedings] is not a material factor
  in whether Horizon during your tenure caused bugs to you."
</blockquote><p>
After a bit more on this theme, perhaps the judge sees the issue clearly, 
he says "I think [this sequence of cross-examination]
has probably gone on long enough."
</p><p>
So, is the direction of causation an issue?  In a word, no.
As in my murder trial analogy: the fact that the police and prosecutors
have come to suspect a particular individual doesn't <em>cause</em> him to
commit a murder some time previously.
</p><p>
Or another coin-tossing example.  Suppose two coins are tossed, and
you are interested in the probability that both show a "head".
</p><p>
A preliminary point here, on our intuitions about the notion of
probability.  If a coin is to be tossed in the future,
then to say that there is a 50% probability that it will show a head has
one meaning - most easily expressed that if you were to do it repeatedly,
then half of the trials would show a head.
</p><p>
If a coin has <em>already been</em> tossed,
then its probability of being a head 
is either 100% or 0%, you just don't know which. 
To say that the probability of it being a head is 50% is a description
not of the facts, but of your estimate of the facts.
And then, after looking at the coin, your assessment of the facts will 
change, you will now say that the probability of it being a head
is 100%, or it is 0%, as the case may be.
(And of course your looking at the coin doesn't <em>cause</em>
it to be a head or not).
</p><p>
So now consider two coins tossed.  On your knowledge at this point,
the probability of both being heads is 25% (50% squared).
If someone looks at the first coin and tells you that it is a head,
then the probability of both being heads is now 50%.
(In the theory of probability, these are the prior and posterior probabilities
of Bayes' Theorem. 
Using Dr Worden's words, this new knowledge changes the whole ball game,
but probability theory is nonetheless still relevant.)
The probability changed, with no causation involved.
Now, a second scenario, you are told that in fact the first coin tossed
is a double-headed coin.  Again the probability of both being heads is now 50%.
Here there is causation involved, the fact of one coin being double-headed
causes it to be more likely that both show heads.
</p><p>
But the numbers are the same in each scenario, and for the same reason.  
Whether causation is involved or not is irrelevant.
</p><h3>
The Suspense Account
</h3><p>
So what of the judge's "long digression" (paras 810-820),
before he gets to the nub of why Dr Worden's approach is nonsense?
Well, it can be put into the context of my murder trial analogy, thus:
</p><p>
(a) you should take into account that the homicide rate varies between
male and female, young and old, and adapt your numbers to the age and sex 
of the accused (etc) 
</p><p>
(b) the homicide rate may be (a lot) higher than you are actually aware of
</p><p>
Both points are correct, but tinker around the edges of the issue:
neither point changes the fact that Dr Worden's approach is quite unsound.
Which is why I call the passage a long digression.
</p><p>
But it is a really interesting digression.  Because on point (b), the issue
is that the Post Office ran a suspense account.  This consisted of all
the bits of money the Post Office had, but didn't know why it had them
(or, one must infer, whether it should have them).
</p><p>
This really made me think WTF???  The Post Office runs an accounting 
system which can't tell where all their money has come from.
So why does it think that its accounting system is good enough to tell
it that missing amounts of money must be the fault of the postmasters? 
</p><p>
Maybe I'm naive: maybe this is normal in such large organizations.
Page 208 of Nick Wallis's book suggests that it would be a 
"miracle of finance" not to require such a suspense account.
But I stand by saying that if their accounting system 
can't tell why they have the money they have,
then it can't possibly be adequate to tell them why they are missing
the money they are missing.
</p><p>
And I won't deny that the Post Office's accounting is probably better than my
own.  For example, I often find myself wondering where all the money
I took out of an ATM a week ago has gone.  But I don't go making 
accusations of theft against the visitors to my home during that week!
</p><p>
There is a further point here which I myself didn't pick up
until reading Paul Marshall's submission to the Williams Inquiry:
how can they be sure that none of the amounts
in the suspense account are actually the very same amounts that are missing
from the subpostmasters' accounts?  If these could be the same amounts,
then the Post Office was prosecuting subpostmasters for missing money which
was actually in the Post Office's hands.
</p><p>
This is alluded to in para 810 of the judgment (quoting the claimants)
</p><blockquote>
  "38. The Defendant operated one or more suspense accounts in which
  it held unattributed surpluses including those generated from branch
  accounts. After a period of 3 years, such unattributed surpluses were
  credited to the Defendant's profits and reflected in its profit and
  loss accounts.
</p><p>
  39. The Defendant thereby stood to benefit and/or did benefit from
  apparent shortfalls wrongly attributed to the Claimants which did not
  represent real losses to the Defendant."
</blockquote><p>
and in Nick Wallis's book at page 381:
</p><blockquote>
  'The Post Office has improperly enriched itself through the
  decades,' he [Second Sight's Ron Warmington] thundered,
  'with funds that have passed through its own
  suspense accounts.  Had its own staff more diligently investigated in
  order to establish who were the rightful owners of those funds, they
  would have been returned to them, whether they were Post Office's
  customers or its Subpostmasters. ...'

Coincidentally, an illustration from my own experience
</h3><p>
I read Nick's book over four days.  By quite a striking coincidence,
during those very four days, I received a cheque for over &pound;18000,
paid to me in error.  (It was for the redemption
of a share fund investment - but the same 
amount had also been deposited into my bank account).
</p><p>
I am not making this up!  Even though Dr Worden's arguments would
conclude that I am, as follows (paragraph numbers are references
to the analogous paragraphs in his first report):
</p><ul><li>
  if the financial institution paid me double then it would most
  likely have paid everyone double, on average (see para 784.2)
</li><li>
  if the financial institution paid out everyone double,
  then it would fairly quickly notice the situation
  (see paras 785, 787-791) (this point I can accept)
</li><li>
  (therefore, we infer) it didn't happen, to me or to anyone else
</li></ul><p>
or, putting his argument another way 
</p><ul><li>
  after a lot of effort making an educated guess, say that
  the institution's accounting systems suffer a glitch like this
  at a rate of one per 10,000 customers (or some other plausible number) 
  and the amount of money involved (averaged over all customers) is
  (according to the average account size) say &pound;3 (see paras 746-748)
</li><li>
  this is a tiny fraction of &pound;18000,
  the amount of error I claim to have seen (see para 751)
</li><li>
  (therefore, we infer) it is most unlikely that this has happened to me
  and so I must be making this up 
</li></ul><p>
The bottom line of all this is obviously that it is possible for a system
to make errors occasionally, and not to make them all the time.
</p><p>
So how do we evaluate the famous statement by Lord Hoffmann 
"It is notorious that one needs no expertise in electronics
to be able to know whether a computer is working properly."
(DPP v. McKeown and Jones [1997] 1 WLR 295, 201 C-D,

in the context of this incident?

</p><p>
Apart from the fact that this is "expert" evidence given from the bench, 
and so not subject to cross-examination, by a person unqualified to give 
such evidence, it's just plain wrong.
</p><p>
Mostly the institution's systems work fine.  
This will be the experience of experts in electronics and non-experts alike.
Sometimes (rarely), as on this occasion, they don't.
Almost all experts and non-experts alike will be unaware of that.  
The tiny fraction of people affected, experts and non-experts alike
will be aware of it (at least when the amount involved is &pound;18000).
</p><p>
Possibly the error was triggered by unusual or idiosyncratic 
human input.  
Or possibly human error, not caught by the computer-based accounting system.
Who knows?  And, in the context of 
prosecuting people on account of such errors, so what?
