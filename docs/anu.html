  <H2>Retirement</H2>
  In retirement I've been doing more of a variety of things, including
  <ul>
  <li> some category theory proofs in Coq
  <li> reverting to my earlier interest in the law, including being rather outspoken
  about legal issues and cases that attract my interest, see further 
  <a href = legal/ >here</a>
  </ul>

  <H2>Employment (1998-2021)</H2>
    <P>
      For this period of 24 years I was at the
      Logic and Computation Group in the 
      <a href= http://rsise.anu.edu.au/ >
      Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering</a>
      at the <A href="http://www.anu.edu.au/textonly/external.html" >
      Australian National University</A>,
      subsequently in the <a href= http://cs.anu.edu.au/ >
      Research School of Computer Science</a>,
      part of the <a href= http://cecs.anu.edu.au/ >
      College of Engineering and Computer Science</a>,
      see further details below.
      
    <p>
    I have held positions under various funding sources including
    ARC Discovery Projects held by 
    <A href = http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rpg/ >Rajeev Gor&eacute;</a>
    concerned with verifying cut-admissibility theorems, interpolation
    theorems and similar meta-logical results.
    <p>
      My earlier research work in computer science 
      was largely about embedding a display
      calculus in Isabelle/HOL, and proving, in Isabelle, Belnap's 
      cut-elimination theorem.  In the course of work on a stronger result,
      the strong normalization property of the set of proof reductions used
      in cut-elimination, we discovered that the published proof of this
      omits a case, requiring a largely new proof, which we have now completed.
      The Isabelle files are <a href = isabelle/2005/fdeep/> here</a>.
      <p>
      We then realized that this proof can be translated into the context
      of general term-rewriting theory, and have accordingly derived 
      theorems on termination of term-rewriting.
      The Isabelle files are <a href = isabelle/2005/snabs/> here</a>.  
      <p>
      Topics I have worked on more recently have included
      <ul>
      <li> proving in Isabelle a version of Craig's interpolation theorem
      for Display Calculi, 
      based on work of James Brotherston and Rajeev Gor&eacute;.
      The Isabelle files are <a href = isabelle/2005/interp/> here</a>  
      <li>
      formalising in Isabelle some aspects of a claimed (and later
      contradicted) proof of decidability of ticket entailment.
      The Isabelle files are <a href = isabelle/2005/bimbo-dunn/ >here</a> 
    <li> formalising in Isabelle results of Nachum Dershowitz about
    well-founded unions of well-founded relations.
      The Isabelle files are <a href = isabelle/2005/gen/ >here</a>
      (see <code>tripartite.{thy,ML}</code>)
      <li>
      formalising in Isabelle results on proof systems for 
       Full Intuitionistic Linear Logic, based on work with 
      Alwen Tiu, Ranald Clouston and Rajeev Gor&eacute;.
      The Isabelle files are <a href = isabelle/2005/seqms/ >here</a>
<li>formalising in HOL4 a dual tableaux calculus of Melvin Fitting
for intuitionistic logic.
      The HOL4 files are <a href = hol/idt/hol >here</a>
      <li>
      proving in Coq cut admissibility for Dyckhoff's LJT system for 
      intuitionistic propositional logic (designed to easily show 
      decidability), and an attempted simpler variation
     <li>
      formalising in Coq the syntactic (ie, by transforming a derivation tree)
      proof of cut admissibility for linear logic 
      </ul>
<p>

  <H2>Studies/Thesis (1997)</H2>
    <P>
      In 1997 I did the Graduate Diploma in Computer Science.
      My honours thesis,
      Mechanised Proof Systems for Relation Algebras,
      was on automating display logic in 
      <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/HVG/isabelle.html">
      Isabelle</A>;
      my supervisor was 
      <a href="http://cecs.anu.edu.au/~rpg"> Rajeev Gor&eacute</a>
      of the Automated Reasoning Group.
      In 1998 and late 1999
      I did some further work along these lines, see the papers below.
    </P>
    <P>
     Here are copies of my thesis, in
     <a href="thesis/thesis.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>,
     <a href="thesis/thesis.dvi.gz">dvi.gz</a>,
     and <a href="thesis/thesis-files">here</a> 
     are the source code files referred to in it.
    </P>

  <H2>Earlier employment (up to 1996)</H2>
  I have previously worked (among others)
  in CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics
  (doing statistical analyses and research in combinatorial mathematics, 
  particularly matroid theory), 
  and in the Department of Defence, doing Computer Security, where I became
  interested in the formal verification of software.
  At one point I studied law and worked in the office administering the
  Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, in the Review and Reconsideration area,
  handling appeals against the office's decisions.

  <H2>Projects</H2>
  <H3>L4.verified</H3>
  For about three years I was actively involved in NICTA's L4.verified project,
  which used Isabelle to formally verify an operating system microkernel.
  In that project I was primarily responsible for the library concerning
  machine words of definite finite lengths and the hardware operations on them,
  obtaining relevant lemmas and automated proof precedures.
  See the AVOCS'07 paper listed below.
  
  <H3>EVACS</H3>
  In 2001, I wrote a prototype vote-counting program for the complex
  proportional representation system used in electing the ACT Assembly.
  Recently the requirements of the system have been encoded in the language
  of the HOL theorem proving system and I am engaged in similarly encoding 
  the actions of my program, with a view to formally proving that it 
  correctly meets its requirements.

as can be produced interactively and displayed by the
