  <H1>The Streisand Effect</H1>

  <H2>What is the Streisand Effect?</H2>
    <P> Described
    <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect >here</a>
    <blockquote>
    The <b>Streisand effect</b> is an unintended consequence
    of attempts to hide, remove, or censor information,
    where the effort instead increases public awareness of the information.
    </blockquote>
    The name came about when the famous actress sued (unsuccessfully)
    to have a photograph of her house removed from the internet. But it
    <blockquote>
    had been downloaded only six times prior to Streisand's lawsuit,
    two of those being by Streisand's attorneys. Public awareness
    of the case led to more than 420,000 people visiting the site over
    the following month.
    </blockquote>
In the case of one recent incident (litigation to have a publicly available

>report (8MB)</a> removed) the press has noted the Streisand effect,
see <a href = https://www.leefang.com/p/venture-capitalist-invokes-trans
>here</a>
<blockquote>
Because of Blackman's heavy-handed lawsuit, Poulson's reporting
now has coverage in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Daily Mail, and
Courthouse News – a classic example of the so-called 'Streisand effect.'
</blockquote>
and <a href = https://freedom.press/issues/anatomy-of-a-censorship-campaign-a-tech-execs-crusade-to-silence-a-journalist/
>here</a>
<blockquote>
Blackman admitted in his declaration that since he sued Poulson, "the
sealed report and its contents ... have been spread and are spreading
far more broadly than before." It sounds like he’s already learning
about the Streisand Effect — let's make sure the next SLAPP-happy
tech bro knows about it too.

<H2>What is this site about?</H2>
<p>
Frequently there are attempts to punish or suppress people expressing their
views.
And I've observed that even when such attempts are well reported,
there is often no link to what those people have said or written.
</p> <p>
  These pages aim to provide those links, with the aim of increasing the
  readership of that speech or writing. The goal of this is to make
  the punishment or attempted suppression of it ineffective and
  counterproductive. And hopefully to deter such punishment or suppression.
</p>

  <H2>Why now?</H2>
  <p>
  Well, I've had this idea for some time, was spurred on to action when
  one day I got several emails with articles about the police action against
  <a href = ./asa-winstanley.html >Asa Winstanley</a>.
  So he is the first writer whose work I want to support and publicise.
</p>
  <H2>Note re internet archives</H2>
  Sometimes material which has been on the internet is removed.
  This can be for various reasons, often that someone has decided that they
  don't want you reading it.
(In that case they may or may not have legal authority
to say you shouldn't read it.)
There are places which keep a record of material which has been on the internet
in the past.
The ones I know of are
<ul><li>
<a href = https://archive.org/ >Internet Archive's Wayback Machine</a> and
</li><li>
<a href = https://archive.today/ >archive.today</a>
(also accessible at archive.li, archive.md, archive.ph, archive.is, archive.vn)
</li></ul>
<p>
Thus, for example, where someone complains that the list of MPs
in the group called Labour Friends of Israel (in the UK)
is no longer accessible, you can do a web search:
(in archive.today), first for https://www.lfi.org.uk/*,
find the URL you want, which is
https://www.lfi.org.uk/lfi-parliamentary-supporters/,
then search for that to see the page as it was saved at some past dates,
of which the most recent is
<a href = https://archive.md/ykLus >https://archive.md/ykLus</a>
</p> <p>
Or when the complaint is made that Keir Starmer's
"ten pledges" have now been erased from his website:
(in archive.today), first search for https://keirstarmer.com/*
and find the right URL, which is https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/,
to get the archived version at
<a href = https://archive.vn/AayAz >https://archive.vn/AayAz</a>

Then investigations by Palestine Declassified and myself were followed
by AWIS shutting down its website and all of its social media.

<h2> Plans for this blog</h2>
<p>
I'll probably put this stuff on substack or somewhere similar,
if and when I work out how to use it effectively.
Meanwhile I do seem to have succeeded in setting up something at
<a href = https://streisandeffect.substack.com/ >
https://streisandeffect.substack.com/</a>,
and an email address streisandeffect@substack.com
So far I've paid more attention to writing than to working out
how to put it somewhere like substack; but this page has links to it all.
</p> <p>
So what is intended to follow here is an expanding list of references
to particular cases, with their consequent reading recommendations.
Please send me suggestions of similar items to add!
</p>

  <H2>Particular cases or categories</H2>
  <h3>Asa Winstanley</h3>
  Read more <a href = ./asa-winstanley.html >here</a></h3>.
  Writer about Palestine etc, investigated for terrorism, involving a dawn
  police raid on his home, and confiscation of his electronic devices.
Read his writing on his substack
<a href = https://asawinstanley.substack.com/ >Palestine is Still the
Issue</a> or at the
<a href = https://electronicintifada.net/people/asa-winstanley
>Electronic Intifada</a>.

<h3>Other UK police actions</h3>
These keep on happening, challenging my capacity to keep up with them.
See <a href = ./uk-police.html >separate article here</a>.
I've also written an <a href = ./terrorism.html >
article about the legislation underlying a lot of the actions</a>.

<h3>Other government actions</h3>
Common examples are expulsion from a country (or eg cancelling visas),
arrests of journalists etc.
See <a href = ./other-govt.html >this article here</a>.
