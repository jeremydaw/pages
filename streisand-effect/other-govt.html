  <H1>Other Government actions</H1>
Here we list cases of government actions such as
travel restrictions (eg cancelling visas), arrest or mistreatment of
journalists, etc.

<h2>Jeremy Loffredo</h2>
Arrested apparently for a report about
<blockquote>
strikes launched at military targets inside Israel by Iran.
He was blindfolded, shackled in a military truck and placed in solitary
confinement for three days with little food or water. He was eventually
deported.
</blockquote>
Here is the
<a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu0zptW49eM >video report</a>,
here is a <a href =
https://thegrayzone.com/2024/10/11/israeli-jails-grayzones-jeremy-loffredo/
>Grayzone article about it</a>,
and here is <a href =
https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/israels-war-on-the-foreign-press
>an interview with Chris Hedges</a>.

<h2>Scott Ritter</h2>
<p>
I mention him after reading his account:
<blockquote>
Unfortunately, the US government had other plans - I was prevented from
boarding my flight out of JFK on June 3 by three armed Customs and Border
Protection officers, who seized my passport under instructions from the
State Department.
</blockquote>
as described <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/ask-the-inspectorus-tour-of-duty >here</a>,
but he also records that he had been "targeted" by the USA government
long before that:
<blockquote>
The FBI investigated me for making a documentary film, "In Shifting
Sands," which made the case that Iraq had been disarmed by UN weapons
inspectors. Because this movie embraced a narrative which contradicted
the case for war being made by the US government, I was targeted for
character assassination.
</blockquote>
That, and a lot else, are described <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/why-matt-gaetz-matters >here</a>.
</p> <p>
The film, full title
"In Shifting Sands: The Truth About Unscom and the Disarming of Iraq"
is on <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yjv4J6nxdk >Youtube here</a>.
Scott has a <a href = https://scottritter.substack.com/ >substack site</a>.
I came across <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/in-search-of-empathy>this article</a>
on it which I thought particularly worth reading.
<<<<<<< HEAD
</p> <p>
In a more recent <a href = 
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-trump-litmus-test >article</a>
Scott says
<blockquote>
My house was raided by the FBI using FARA as a pretext; in conversations
with the senior FBI agents present, the justification for this raid
stemmed from an article I published on my Substack which addressed the
issue of Russophobia in America, and which incorporated material I had
received from the Russian Ambassador to the United States at the time,
Anatoly Antonov, whom I interviewed for this article.
</blockquote>
He doesn't identify the article but I'm guessing it is <a href = 
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-red-scare-20-russophobia-in-america >
this one</a>.
